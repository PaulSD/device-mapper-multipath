+   "Host:" should be changed to "Generic-ALUA Persona 2 (UARepLun, SESLun, ALUA)".
+
+- Promise VTrak/Vess:
+   "LUN Affinity" and "ALUA" should be changed to "Enable", "Redundancy Type"
+   must be "Active-Active".
+
+- LSI/Engenio/NetApp RDAC class, as NetApp SANtricity E/EF Series and OEM arrays:
+   "Select operating system:" should be changed to "Linux DM-MP (Kernel 3.10 or later)".
+
+- NetApp ONTAP:
+   To check ALUA state: "igroup show -v <igroup_name>", and to enable ALUA:
