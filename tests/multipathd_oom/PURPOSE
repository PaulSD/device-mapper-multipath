the oom_adj is -17 and oom_score_adj is -1000 after installing device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-53.el6.x86_64 and starting multipathd.
This means multipathd will never be selected to be killed by oom according to the kernel doc.


Here are the steps to reproduce this issue.
1. create a multipathed disk /dev/mapper/mpathb via scsi_debug using all the free memory. this will consume most of the free mem.
2. io stress on the multipath disk, this step is option.
#dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/mpathb & 
3. consuming the free mem
#for i in `seq 10000`; do array[$i]=$(</var/log/messages); done &
4. trigger the oom_killer manually 
#while true; do echo f > /proc/sysrq-trigger ; done
5. check the console or /var/log/message if multipathd is killed
